# How to run
For convenience, this repository provides most TypeScript (.ts) files already compiled into JavaScript (.js).
Simply open each .html file in a browser to test each one, host a local server, etc.

If you want to compile the existing TS files or add your own, make sure you run `npm install`.
If you are on Windows you can run the `atsc.bat` script to compile all files or add the activity number to compile just that one.
